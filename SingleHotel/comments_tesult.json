The view is great looking at Victoria habor. \nThe executive lounge, Manor Club, is one of the best that I have been to in Hong Kong. The staff is friendly, the view is great but there is not much food choice for breakfast.\n\nMy dinner with friends at Holt\u2019s cafe was not a plesant one. The food was below average. Either the food was too salty or it was too plain. Since its just opened, I think it still needs time to adjust the food in order to be comparable to other hotel based restaurants.\n\nOverall it was a pleasant stay in Rosewood. However its still very new and it needs time for improvement especially interstaff communication and room ammenities.", "date": "Reviewed Apr 20, 2019"},
