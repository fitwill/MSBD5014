2018年06月24日評價,最差的入住体验了，一共住了3晚，到第二天下午空调就坏了，香港30多度的天，在酒店汗流浃背，然后晚上8点说空调修好了，然而并没有，第三天一直到退房，酒店的空调都是坏的，去前台问，只是让我排在准备checkin的长长队伍后面等待，没有任何赔偿措施。来香港10几次，住过不同的五星级酒店，这次是最差的了，还有这次住的楼层有好多房间在装修，味道非常刺鼻。九龙的香格里拉是目前住过最差的，管理服务都不行，唯一的优点就是房间比较大了。总之是非常差的入住体验。,有待改善,2.0

2018年05月01日評價,有夜景，離地鐵站近，搭船叫車都很容易，附近吃東西或者是購物都方便，入住飯店時招待人員也很專業、友善，下次來香港仍會想要到這裡，房間空間寬敞設備也很齊全，是很不錯的體驗。,無與倫比,10.0
2018年04月07日評價,"人員服務很好，房間也很乾淨
我們是住低樓層海灣房，但是1F戶外 花園區開放到凌晨01:00還是02:00，客人們聊天的聲音在房間都聽得到，沒戴耳塞就不能好好入睡>_<    幾十年的玻璃隔音不行了! ! (其實白天的車子聲音也聽得很清楚)  應該是飯店業者要考慮改善的地方 。

2017年11月19日評價,服务很好，地点很棒。酒店大堂工作人员非常热情，打车服务非常到位。下次再来可以考虑再次入住！唯一的缺陷就是楼数不是很高，海景无法包括完整维多利亚景色。,無與倫比,10.0

房間乾淨整潔，每次出去回來都有人進來整理
非常推薦豪華閣的早餐咖啡和景觀，
有來入住一定要上去看看哦
但是飯店提供的自助早餐卻不怎麼樣
下次會想要再住的飯店",無與倫比,10.0
2017年07月08日評價,"My wife and I both got a flu using our stay. We called the guest service desk, they have us the place to see the doctor. Surprisingly all the staff know we were not feeling well since then. From the room cleaning lady, to the Chinese restaurant manager (they cook a pot of ginger tea for us), to the front desk lady (she granted us a late check out until 5pm), were all so nice and personal. 
As a business person, I traveled many many places and stayed many many hotel, but this one really impressed me!
If we didn't got sick, may be I won't discover the excellent training of this hotel staff! Truly deserved the 5-star rating.",無與倫比,10.0

2017年04月16日評價,從機場快線下車之後可以搭K3免費接駁車，最後一站就是九龍香格里拉飯店，直接送到門口非常方便。我們一下免費接駁車就馬上有很美的飯店人員很有禮貌面帶微笑的來迎接我們，感覺心情很美好。她帶我們到櫃台check in 與寄行李。整體上飯店人員都很親切，每位人員都面帶微笑、熱心幫忙，服務超級好。尤其是host很漂亮又super nice! 飯店一走進去感覺很豪華，整個很舒服。飯店的房間蠻大的，能看到很美維多利亞港和對岸壯觀的buildings. 床很舒服，浴室也很大。衣櫥裡面有熨斗，完全不怕襯衫帶到飯店很皺，超級貼心的！飯店地點非常的很好，走出去就是尖東/尖沙咀站，有地鐵到哪裡都很方便！不用走到天荒地老，旁邊就有吃的，對面也有星巴克。超級推薦的飯店！下次來我還會住這裡！,心水之選,8.0

The bar was not good, however, hence only 4 out of 5. We used the Intercontinental’s lounge bar in the evening a few times instead. Otherwise, absolutely fantastic hotel at a great price. ",心水之選,8.0

2019年08月23日評價,"Disappointed by the rather outdated decor and room condition of a Shangri-La establishment. Request for late checkout was met with, “we’ll charge you half day rates”. Never happened with Intercontinental or Marriott hotels I’ve put up at. Location is good though as it is accessible to a lot of eateries and convenient to move around.",良好,6.0
2019年08月25日評價,"Great location, clean, very comfortable bed and great room with good amenities, the Kowloon Shangrii-La is just what the doctor ordered after a long, international flight.  

My room was extremely quiet with shutters and drapes which keep it nice and dark for sleeping in.  

The king sized bed was fantastic, the bathroom had both a bathtub and a great shower with wonderful water pressure and hot water.

The mini bar was nice and well stocked.  I ordered room service and the food was above average.

The hotel is a bit pricey, but sometimes you get what you pay for.  

There could be more premium movie channels (there were none from my experience).",心水之選,8.0

Highly highly recommend it:-)
